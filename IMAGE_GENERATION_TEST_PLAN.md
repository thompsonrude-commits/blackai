# Image Generation Testing Plan - Physical Verification

## CRITICAL PRINCIPLE

**NEVER claim image generation works until you physically see REAL AI-generated images in the browser.**

SVG placeholders, stock photos, and retrieved images DO NOT count as "generated".

---

## PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### ✅ Infrastructure Verification

- [ ] GPU server is running (check `nvidia-smi`)
- [ ] ComfyUI is accessible (open web UI in browser)
- [ ] Models are downloaded (check `models/checkpoints/` folder)
- [ ] Test workflow generates image in ComfyUI web UI
- [ ] API endpoint responds to `/system_stats` request
- [ ] Firebase secret `COMFYUI_ENDPOINT` is set correctly
- [ ] Backend deployed with updated code

### ✅ Backend Verification

- [ ] `nativeAIEngine.ts` compiles without errors
- [ ] `media/engine.ts` includes native-gpu provider
- [ ] Provider chain is: native-gpu → openrouter → legacy-image-provider
- [ ] Logs show "PRIMARY: Trying native GPU generation"

- ✅ Logs show "Native GPU not available" → "FALLBACK 1: OpenRouter"
- ✅ Image still generates (from DALL-E 3)
- ✅ Metadata shows `provider: "openrouter"`
- ✅ With GPU online: Uses native-gpu again

**Failure Indicators**:
- ❌ Complete failure when GPU offline
- ❌ No fallback attempt
- ❌ Doesn't recover when GPU comes back

---

### Test 10: Metadata Accuracy

**Actions**:
1. Generate any image
2. Inspect response metadata
3. Verify all fields are accurate

**Expected Metadata**:
```json
{
  "imageUrl": "data:image/png;base64,...",
  "provider": "native-gpu",
  "model": "Stable Diffusion XL Turbo",
  "latencyMs": 12000,
  "metadata": {
    "imageType": "photorealistic",
    "seed": 123456,
    "steps": 20,
    "cfg_scale": 7.5,
    "sampler": "euler_ancestral",
    "resolution": "1024x1024"
  }
}
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ `provider` matches actual source (not lie)
- ✅ `model` is real model name (not "auto" or "unknown")
- ✅ `latencyMs` is realistic (5000-30000ms for GPU)
- ✅ `imageType` is correctly classified
- ✅ `seed` is number (for reproducibility)

**Failure Indicators**:
- ❌ `provider: "native-gpu"` but actually used external API
- ❌ `model: "unknown"`
- ❌ Missing metadata fields
- ❌ Dishonest data

## BUG REPORTING TEMPLATE

If any test fails, document using this format:

```markdown
### Bug: [Short Description]

**Test**: Test 3: 3D Render
**Prompt**: "3D render of futuristic Nigerian building..."

**Expected**: High-quality 3D rendered image using FLUX model
**Actual**: Received SVG placeholder with generic building icon

**Screenshots**:
- [Attach screenshot of browser]
- [Attach screenshot of network tab showing response]

**Logs**:
```
[MediaEngine] PRIMARY: Trying native GPU generation
[NativeAI] Generation failed: CUDA out of memory
[MediaEngine] ✗ native-gpu failed: CUDA OOM
[MediaEngine] FALLBACK 1: Trying OpenRouter
[MediaEngine] ✗ openrouter failed: Rate limit
[MediaEngine] FALLBACK 2: Trying legacy-image-provider
[MediaEngine] ✗ legacy-image-provider failed: 403 Forbidden
[MediaEngine] All providers exhausted
```

**Root Cause**: GPU ran out of VRAM (using 24GB model on 16GB GPU)

**Fix**: Switch to smaller model (SDXL Turbo instead of FLUX Dev)

**Status**: Fixed ✅ / In Progress 🔄 / Blocked 🚫
```

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

The image generation system is considered **WORKING** only when:

1. ✅ All 10 tests pass
2. ✅ 100% of successful generations use native-gpu provider
3. ✅ 0% SVG placeholders in successful cases
4. ✅ All images are physically verifiable as AI-generated
5. ✅ Metadata is accurate and honest
6. ✅ Fallback chain works when GPU offline
7. ✅ Cost per image < $0.01 average
8. ✅ User can see the difference between native and fallback generations

**DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION UNTIL ALL CRITERIA ARE MET.**

---

## POST-DEPLOYMENT MONITORING

After deployment, monitor these metrics:

### Daily Checks
- [ ] Provider usage: native-gpu vs fallbacks
- [ ] Average generation time
- [ ] Error rate per provider
- [ ] Image validation pass rate
- [ ] User complaints about quality

### Weekly Checks
- [ ] Cost analysis (GPU hours vs API costs)
- [ ] GPU utilization (peak/average)
- [ ] Model performance (which models used most)
- [ ] Fallback frequency (should be <5%)

### Monthly Review
- [ ] Total cost vs budget
- [ ] Image quality feedback
- [ ] Model updates needed
- [ ] Infrastructure scaling needs

---

## REGRESSION TESTING

Run this test suite:
- After any backend code changes
- After model updates
- After GPU infrastructure changes
- Monthly as scheduled maintenance

**Automate where possible**:
```bash
# Test script example
npm run test:image-generation

# Should test:
# - Native AI engine compiles
# - ComfyUI endpoint responds
# - Image generation succeeds
# - Metadata is accurate
# - File size validation passes
```

---

## CONCLUSION

**The ONLY way to know image generation works is to:**

1. Generate an image
2. Open it in the browser
3. Verify it's NOT an SVG placeholder
4. Verify it's NOT a stock photo
5. Verify the metadata says "native-gpu"
6. Verify the backend logs show native GPU was used

**If ANY of these fail, the system is BROKEN and needs fixing before claiming it works.**

**NO SHORTCUTS. NO ASSUMPTIONS. PHYSICAL TESTING ONLY.**
