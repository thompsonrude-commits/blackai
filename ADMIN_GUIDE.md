## 🤖 Auto-Learning System

The AI now **automatically learns** from user interactions!

### Correction Detection
When users say things like:
- "Correction: [the correct answer]"
- "That is wrong, it should be..."
- "The correct answer is..."
- "Not correct, [correct version]"

The AI will **automatically save** the correction to the training database.

### Conversation Learning
The AI learns natural conversation patterns by monitoring:
- User questions and responses
- Language flow and structure
- Common phrases in different languages

### How It Works:
1. User chats with AI in any language (Pidgin, Edo, Yoruba, etc.)
2. If AI makes a mistake, user says "Correction: [correct answer]"
3. System automatically saves the correction
4. AI learns and improves over time
5. All corrections appear in the Training Studio

---

## 🌍 Language Updates Deployed

### Nigerian Pidgin Fixes:
✅ **Pronoun usage corrected**:
- "I" = subject (I go, I dey, I wan)
- "me" = object (tell me, show me)
- No more "me dey fine" or "tell I wetin"

✅ **Examples taught**:
- "How far?" → "I dey fine o!"
- "Tell me wetin you need" (not "tell I")
- "I no know" (not "me no know")

### Edo Language Enhancements:
✅ **Comprehensive greetings from native speakers**:
- Koyọ → Domo (respectful response)
- Vbọ yehẹ? → Ọ yẹse (It's fine)
- Koyọ baba → Ee koyọ ovbi mwẹn (parent greeting)

✅ **Additional verified content**:
- Common sentences (I dee, I rri owa, etc.)
- More vocabulary (Tuẹ=greet, Ra=or, Ghẹ=do not)
- Parent greetings with proper responses
- Natural conversation patterns

✅ **Zero Pidgin mixing**:
- AI will NEVER use "I go", "wetin", "dey", "na" in Edo responses
- Every word must be pure Edo
