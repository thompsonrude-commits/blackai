# Ultimate AI Implementation Status

## Scope
This repo is treated as an existing AI platform and not a blank-slate rebuild. The work has focused on wiring existing engines, normalizing the canonical routes, correcting fallback honesty, and validating the live local backend path without inventing unsupported capabilities.

## Status summary
- Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED / VERIFIED WHERE POSSIBLE
- Verified locally: canonical provider and lexicon routes, local image fallback semantics, TypeScript build checks
- Blocked externally: live Gemini/OpenRouter/Groq/Ollama/provider-dependent generation calls require valid secrets and/or services

## Existing engines discovered and activated
- Chat orchestration: implemented and wired through shared request flow
- Language routing: targetLanguage propagation is active through frontend/backend flow
- Edo lexicon: file-backed store is active and queryable through the canonical API
- Image/media pipeline: canonical generation route is active and fallback semantics are enforced
- Provider registry: health/status route is active and reports truthful states
- Search/web and document/OCR/music/voice modules: present in architecture but still require live-service validation in a credentialed environment

## Engine activation progress
- Chat: implemented and connected to shared request routing
- Language: implemented with explicit language targeting and conservative Edo prompt augmentation
- Edo lexicon: activated through backend route and store
- Image pipeline: canonical route restored and fallback behavior corrected
- Provider health reporting: active and honest
- Local bridge: active for canonical API aliasing and validation

## Providers
Provider families present in the repo and/or wired in the architecture include:
- Gemini
- Grok
- Groq
- OpenRouter
- Ollama
- HuggingFace
- Mistral
- Together
- legacy-image-provider
- other adapters already present in repository

Authoritative status behavior:
- READY when the provider is configured and usable
- NOT_CONFIGURED when credentials or local setup are absent
- AUTH_FAILED for invalid credentials
- MODEL_NOT_FOUND when a requested model is not available
- RATE_LIMITED / QUOTA_EXCEEDED / TIMEOUT / NETWORK_ERROR / UNAVAILABLE / DISABLED / UNKNOWN when applicable

## Canonical route integrity
- Guardian rule applied: do not silently substitute a different provider when fallback is disabled
- Image fallback semantics are now truthful and metadata-aware
- Frontend request path now passes targetLanguage through to the backend

## Edo capability
- Edo prompt routing is supported as a first-class language target
- Lexicon system stores vocabulary and metadata including source, definition, examples, approval status, and review information
- Output remains conservative and does not invent unsupported Edo terminology without a controlled lexicon path

## Document, spreadsheet, OCR, voice, music, and search
These remain partially integrated in the codebase and are not treated as fully verified until live tests are executed in a properly configured environment.

## Verified implementation details
- /api/v1/providers returns provider status truthfully
- /api/v1/edo/lexicon responds successfully
- /api/v1/image/generate respects allowFallback semantics
- Frontend and backend language targeting is connected
- TypeScript project validation passes for the app and Firebase functions package

## Blocked or unverified capabilities
- Real Gemini-backed generation requires a valid GEMINI_KEY
- Real OpenRouter calls require a valid OPENROUTER_KEY
- Groq requests are blocked when the configured credentials are invalid or unavailable
- Ollama local access remains environment-dependent
- Firestore/analytics/admin data flows remain environment-dependent
- Full end-to-end document, OCR, spreadsheet, TTS, music, and voice workflows require live credentialed services and file-level validation

## Remaining work
1. Configure real provider credentials in a valid environment
2. Validate provider-backed chat and image generation end-to-end
3. Expand Edo lexicon approval workflow and grammar validation
4. Validate document/OCR/spreadsheet extraction with real files
5. Validate TTS/STT, voice workflows, and music generation if supported by configured services
6. Connect real analytics/admin/trainer flows with proper backend security and permissions

## Final assessment
The repository has been moved closer to the intended multipurpose architecture by wiring existing systems together, correcting canonical fallback behavior, and preserving truthful status reporting. The app is now more coherent and less prone to fake success, but it is not yet production-complete without configured external services and a broader credentialed validation phase.
